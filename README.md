## How the Game Works

- **XP and Health:** The player's XP and health are displayed and updated throughout the game. Health is lost when the player takes damage from monsters, and XP is earned by defeating them.
- **Inventory:** The player starts with a "Stick" and can buy stronger weapons in the store (Dagger, Thor Hammer, Dragon Slayer Sword).
- **Monster Health:** Each monster has different health based on its level, and the player can attack the monster or dodge its attacks.
- **Winning and Losing:** The player wins by defeating the dragon and earns a victory screen. If the player loses all health, they will respawn at the town square.

## Future Improvements

- Add more monster types and locations.
- Implement a save feature to save progress.
- Add animations and better UI for a more immersive experience.
- Add sound effects and music.
